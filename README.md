### DEXTER
##### LN x Web App Demo
---

TODO:

- Look for generic path, not the hardcoded ones I have in here.
- When you create a wallet for the first time, you need to reload page. Maybe call getInfo again?
- Input forms should actually work.
- invoices
- Make the app look nicer. (react routing maybe?)
- make everything a buffer like its supposed to be
- hook this shit up to testnet and then mainnet (neutrino)

---
If there are any errors with the following instructions you can contact Michael - mcg79@cornell.edu

- What does block number out of range mean (when we are unlocking wallet from simnet on a new btcd instance... is that not allowed?)
