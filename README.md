### DEXTER
##### LN x Web App Demo
---

##### Steps

1. go <a href='https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md'>here</a> and follow the installation instructions to install LND and the necessary packages. You only need to follow until 'installing btcd'. The rest of the stuff we will handle later.

2. Now we are going to start running the actual LND nodes. To make this as simple as possible, we are going to start by running in simnet mode, which means the bitcoin blockchain we are dealing with is locally on your computer. Other options are testnet and mainnet, but those are a bit more complicated and require additional setup.

3. Follow the commands. Each block of code should be run in a different terminal window. I will label each new terminal window and reference the labels so you know which one is currently being written to.

NOTE:

A lot of the steps above are invalid. As we make progress we are figuring that we can do a lot of the setup on behalf of the user. We are trying to determine the best possible way to go about this, but in the meantime you probably only need to init a LND instance to get started.
